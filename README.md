## Hi, I'm Soheila! Nice to meet you! 👋

I'm currently a student at KULeuven studying Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Engineering and Computer Science. But don't let that intimidate you! 😄

I also have experience in Speech and Language Technology, which is pretty cool, right?

When it comes to my research interests, I'm passionate about exploring different areas such as :
- Data mining
- Speech recognition
- Mchine learning

I love working on projects in these fields, and I try to share them with you whenever I can. Of course, if there's no NDA contract or restrictions 😄
