## Hi, I'm Soheila! Nice to meet you! 👋

I'm currently a student at KULeuven studying Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Engineering and Computer Science. But don't let that intimidate you! 😄

I've explored different areas within tech, including:
- data mining
- speech recognition
- machine learning
- computer vision

while I may not be a wizard 😄 or the ultimate authority on these subjects, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my skills. I try to share them with you whenever I can 💛. Of course, if there's no NDA contract or restrictions 😄
